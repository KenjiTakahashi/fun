Fun -> javascript/DOM compiler
==============================

Templates
---------
HTML compiles straight to dom hooks, with a few attributes special cased
	`on(click/mouseover/*)` Event handlers
	`style`, a dictionary where numeric values get "px" added to them
	(`classes`, a list of texts)

Expressions are observed, and the output is always reflected according to the type.
	Texts and Numbers are simply printed
	Dictionaries and Lists print as JSON
	(Colors print as a dot with that color)
	Templates, Functions & Handlers print as <code> with their definitions

Expressions

Function invocations
--------------------
A function invocation evaluates to a variable.
	It "returns" a variable right away.
	It then observes all of its arguments.
	Upon mutation of an argument, it re-evaluates its value and mutates the return variable to that value.
