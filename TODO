- "Items and Item Properties"
	An item iterator referencing a list of items should have the type of "Item". Properties off of the Item are then ItemProperties (note that the value of an ItemProperty may ultimately resolve to an item ID if there is a chain of itemProperties, as in the case of @1.foo.bar, where @1.foo will resolve to an item ID)

BUGS

- "Already subscribed to item property doesn't show up after created"
	Add these lines to the top of chatrooms.fun and start with no data:
		let a = @1
		a.name
	Now create a new room. The room does not show up in the for loop, nor does it show up at the "a.name" hook
